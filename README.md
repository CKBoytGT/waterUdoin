## Technologies Used

The app runs on an Express.js server using Sequelize to connect and perform CRUD operations. The templating language Handlebars.js is used to generate the HTML content. Styling is done through classes from TailwindCSS, plus additional custom CSS where needed, and the 30-day view of water logged is visualized with a line graph from Chart.js.
